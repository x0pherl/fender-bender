# Build123d

The 3d modeling in this project is made possible by Build123d -- a python-based, parametric, boundary representation (BREP) modeling framework for 2D and 3D CAD.  The fender-bender source code should be farily readable to anyone familiar with python, but understanding Build123d is critical for developing parts.

The best source for learning about Build123d is the [build123d documentation](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and going through the [tutorials](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) is absolutely the best way to get comfortable with Build123d.
