Frame Assembly and Installation
########

Now that you've completed the wall assemblies and filament brackets, it's time to put it all together. This section will guide you through the assembly and installation of the frame.

Assembly

.. _prepare-frame:

Inspect and Clean Frames
========

The fitting of the wall assemblies into the frame pulls the whole filament buffer together. Because they need to be printed with supports, it is helpful to take
a moment to inspect the frame and clean up any rough edges or supports that may be left over from the print. Pay careful attention to the slots on the arches where
the walls will be inserted, as any rough edges or supports can make assembly difficult.

.. _bottom-frame:

The Bottom Frame
========

Carefully align one of the wall assembly's curved sides with the arch of the bottom frame. Insert until the guide walls are aligned with the frame slots. We recommend
adding glue to the guide wall slots, but as this connection will only bear the weight of the bottom frame, it is not required; especially if you plan on screwing
the frame to a wall, as the bottom screw will hold the frame in place.

Press the wall assembly firmly into place; you should feel the guide walls snap into place.

.. _connector-frame:

Add the Connector Frame to the bottom assembly
========

The connector frame, given it's straight edges, should be easier to insert, but still merits a quick inspection; especially if you've printed with supports.
Align the connector frame above the flat edges of the bottom wall assembly and press into place. The connector frame should snap into place.

Glue is recommended, but not required.

.. _top-wall-assembly:

Top Wall Assembly
========

The Top wall can now be placed in the connector frame. Align the top wall assebly with the connector frame and press into place. The top wall assembly should snap into place.

Glue is recommended, but not strictly required.

.. _top-frame-assembly:

Top Frame Assembly
========

The Top Frame can now be added, completing the assembly of the frame. Carefully align one of the wall assembly's curved sides with the arch of the bottom frame.
Insert until the guide walls are aligned with the frame slots, then click firmly into place.

Because the top frame will bear the weight of the filament brackets, and may shift as you insert and remove filament brackets, we strongly recommend adding
glue to the slots where the guide walls will be inserted.
