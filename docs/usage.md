#Installation & Usage

## Installation

Ideal placement of your filament buffer is important to reduce friction going into the system while improving ease of access for making filament changes.

The buffer should be places so that there's a straight line from the buffer exit to the MMU unit. For example, with an installation that hangs filament spools from the wall at eye level, and the printer underneath on a table, you would want to position the fender-bender system so that there would be a straight line of tubing from the MMU to each filament bracket's exit tube.

## Usage

Each filament bracket is designed to be removed for loading and unloading. The steps should be fairly intuitive:
- if the filament you want to change is still in the nozzle, unload it from the nozzle using your printer's interface
- remove the filament by pulling it from the spool
- remove locking clips or pin if installed
- lift the desired bracket out of the frame
- push the new filament through the tube into the entry port on the bracket until it extends through to the wheel
- guide the filament around the wheel to the egress tube on the bracket
- push the filament until it loads into your printer and load as normal
- re-insert the filament bracket into the frame -- insert a bit forward and at a slight angle, then push back and click into place.
- (recommended, but not required) re-insert a locking clip or the locking pin to secure the filament bracket into place
