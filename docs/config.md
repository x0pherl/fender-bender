# Creating a Custom Configuration

You can generate custom builds of fender bender by modifying a file in the build-configs directory, and running build.py from the root of the project. The yaml files are somewhat self-documenting, and would allow you to generate say, a 12 filament buffer, support a new tube or connector type.

(more documentation is coming -- in the meantime, if you're looking for more information, please open an issue which would encourage me to get this done :laughing:)
