######### Default Configuration #########
BenderConfig:

## MOST LIKELY preferences to adjust
# output path for generated STL files
  stl_folder: ../stl/minimal-test-set

# if this is set to false then the build script will generated
# alternative parts. Setting this to "False" adds build time and
# may not be necessary for most users
  skip_alt_file_generation: True

# control how many filament brackets can be loaded into the system
# for the Prusa MMU3, set to 5
  filament_count: 3
# adding additional filament counts will generate additional frame
# and guidewall parts for the specified number of filaments
  alternate_filament_counts: []
# thickness of the walls separating the filament chambers
  wall_thickness: 3
# sets the style of the wall generated, can be
#    HEX -- generates walls that are easy to see through for troubleshooting
#    SOLID -- all walls are generated as solid walls
#    DRYBOX -- generates hex interior walls but exterior walls with a thin
#              solid wall to help keep the filament dry while maintaining the
#              hexagon pattern styling
  wall_style: HEX
# the frame style, can be HANGING, STANDING, or HYBRID
# HANGING, adds a wall mount to the back of the frame,
# STANDING, adds a flat stand to the bottom of the frame,
# HYBRID, adds both a wall mount and a stand
  frame_style: "HYBRID"
# the method of locking the frame together, can be CLIP, PIN, BOTH, or NONE
  frame_lock_style: BOTH

# describes the path the filment travels through the bracket. Options are:
# - LEAN_FORWARD: recommended for wall-mounted installations, the side of the
#                 bracket closest to the wall is straight,
#                 the side away from the wall is angled out
# - LEAN_REVERSE: recommended for table-mounted installations, the side of the
#                 bracket closest to the desk surface is angled out,
#                 the side away from the wall is straight up
# - STRAIGHT: filament travels straight in and exits straight out
  bracket_direction: LEAN_FORWARD

## General specifications
# thickness for parts bearing structural elements
  minimum_structural_thickness: 4
# thickness for parts bearing no structural elements
  minimum_thickness: 1
# if you need to enforce a certain bracket depth so you can use multiple configuration brackets
# in the same frame, you can set this to the largest number required
# set to -1 to ignore
  minimum_bracket_depth: -1

# higher numbers result in a smaller rounding radius for edges
  fillet_ratio: 4
# extra gap allowance between parts, adjust as needed for your printer
  tolerance: 0.2

## wheel specifications
  wheel:
# diameter of the wheel, increasing will add to the size of the bracket,
# but may work better with certain materials
    diameter: 50
# number of spokes on the wheel, can be adjusted to increase strength or change appearance
    spoke_count: 5
# how much "wiggle" the wheel has. increasing to mach may result in filament getting stuck between the wheel and the bracket
    lateral_tolerance: 0.6
# how much of a gap to allow between the radius of the wheel and the bracket, adjust if needed for your printer (unlikely)
    radial_tolerance: 0.2
  ## bearing details
    bearing:
      diameter: 12.1
      inner_diameter: 6.1
      shelf_diameter: 8.5
      depth: 4
      print_in_place: False

## Information about the filament tube connectors
  connectors:
    - name: "3mmx6mmm tube connector"
      threaded: False
      file_prefix: ""
      file_suffix: ""
      thread_pitch: 1
      thread_angle: 30
      thread_interference: 0.4
      diameter: 6.5
      length: 6.7
## filament tube details
      tube:
        inner_diameter: 3.55
        outer_diameter: 6.5

#how deep you want the overall assembled frame to be (needs to be large enough to fully contain the buffered filament)
  frame_chamber_depth: 170
# the sizing for the empty space of the hexagon pattern, larger numbers increase visibility and decrease the strength of the walls
  wall_window_apothem: 8
# the sizing for the bars of, larger numbers decrease visibility but increase the strength of the walls
  wall_window_bar_thickness: 1.5

  frame_tongue_depth: 4
# you may want to make the locking pin a little more loose (larger number here) to make the pin
# easier to insert and remove
  frame_lock_pin_tolerance: 0.6
# the base radius of the click lock spheres
  frame_click_sphere_radius: 1

# how far up the filament bracket to place the frame clip with the "CLIP style" frame lock
  frame_clip_depth_offset: 10

## detals for the wall bracket
  wall_bracket_screw_radius: 2.25
  wall_bracket_screw_head_radius: 4.5
  wall_bracket_screw_head_sink: 1.4
## how many interlocking elements to add to the wall bracket
  wall_bracket_post_count: 3

# m4 bolt details (for the desk bracket)
  m4_heatsink_radius: 3
  m4_heatsink_depth: 5
  m4_nut_radius: 4.3
  m4_nut_depth: 5
  m4_shaft_radius: 2.15

#### Notes ####

# generally the first four elements should be the most likely things you may wish to adjust
# I've worked to minimize the number of things directly controlled in the configuration file
# many other settings are derived from these values; calculations are in bank_config.py
# adjusting these settings with care and reason *should* result in a working part, but
# there are no guarantees.  If you encounter issues, please open an issue on the github page
